    <h1>producs iphone</h1>
    <p>
      Up to the iPhone 4, all iPhones and other iOS devices were manufactured by
      Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, new CEO Tim Cook changed Apple's
      manufacturing strategy to diversify its suppliers. The iPhone 4s in 2012
      was the first model to be manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone
      companies: Foxconn and Pegatron, the latter also based in Taiwan. Although
      Foxconn still produces more iPhones, Pegatron's orders have been slowly
      increased: the company made part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, and 30% of
      iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model was produced solely by
      Foxconn.[66] In 2019, Apple investigated reports that some Foxconn
      managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones.[67] In India, Apple
      pays Wistron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer with a plant near Bangalore, to
      assemble iPhones to sell in the region.[68]
